# Intrusive ROM for inverse search problems
Part of course work on data driven methods for complex aerospace systems, Intrusive ROM's were explored on coupling two PDE's, and handling non-homogenous boundary conditions.
## Aim
To understand how effective is Reduced order models for inverse search through gradient free optimization
## Objectives
With the increasing complexity in understanding system of interest (Electrohydrodynamics),
- Transient heat conduction (ddv3/transientHeat.m)
- Coupled diffusion- reaction (ddv4/coupledEquation.m)
- Non linear wave (ddv5/waveEquation.mlx)
- Electrohydrodynamics (ddv5/EHD.mlx)
